# Hogwarts Adventure Game

Welcome to Hogwarts! The mission of this game is to navigate through the rooms of Hogwarts and defeat the basilisk!
The map looks like this:

[0] The Great Hall --> [1] The Gryffindor Common Room --> [2] The Chamber of Secrets ------------------------------------->
[3] Dumbledore's Office --> [4] The Room of Requirement --> [5] Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom

There are three items in the game: a wand, tom riddle's diary, and the sword of gryffindor.
You lose if you kill Dumbledore.
You win if you kill the basilisk.
You start in the Gryffindor Common room.
Boundaries are set where you cannot leave the edge of the map or error messages appear.

HOW TO WIN:
- First find the wand. It is in the Great Hall.
- Next, go to the Room of Requirement where you must use your wand to find and take the sword of gryffindor.
- Next, go to the Chamber of Secrets, where a basilisk awaits.
- Use the sword to kill the basilisk and you win!

*Tom Riddle's diary is in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom and gives the player a clue for how to defeat the basilisk when it is taken.
If you "use" the diary in the Gryffindor Common Room, it is put away and leaves the game.

HOW TO LOSE:
- Find the wand in the Great Hall.
- Go to Dumbledore's office and use the wand. He is now dead.
- You lose because the wand leaves the game and cannot be used to get the sword any longer.

I utilized the template literal feature from Ecmascript 6 in using string interpolation when initializing the game message.
